abstract = "Background: In the adjuvant setting, patients with HER2 breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy have superior survival compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. We previously showed that trastuzumab and chemotherapy induces HER2-specific antibodies which correlate with response to therapy in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. It remained unclear from those studies, however, whether the HER2-specific immunity played a role and if antibody immunity was associated with improved disease free survival in the adjuvant setting. In the present study, we addressed these questions by analyzing sera samples from a subset of patients enrolled in the NCCTG adjuvant trial, N9831, which includes an arm (Arm A) in which trastuzumab was not used. Arms B and C received trastuzumab sequentially or concurrently to chemotherapy, respectively. Methods: Pre-and post-treatment initiation sera were obtained from 50 women enrolled in N9831 (22 Arm A; 14 Arm B, and 14 Arm C). Lambda IgG antibodies (to avoid detection of trastuzumab) to HER2 were measured and presented as an index (>0.2 was considered a positive response). Results: Prior to therapy, across all three arms, N9831 patients had similar mean HER2 IgG levels (0.19 units in Arm A, 0.14 in Arm B, and 0.23 in Arm C, P=0.85). Following treatment, the mean levels of antibodies increased in Arm B to 0.35 units and in Arm C to 0.56 units and were higher (p<0.001) than in Arm A where levels did not increase. The proportion of patients who demonstrated antibody immunity increased by 9% in Arm A, 50% in Arm B and 28% in Arm C (P=0.026). Although the event rate was low in this cohort, Cox modeling suggested that larger increases in antibodies were associated with improved disease free survival (HR=0.23; p=0.04). Conclusions: These results show that the increased antibody immunity observed in adjuvant patients treated with combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy is clinically significant and results from the inclusion of trastuzumab. The findings may have important implications for improving treatment outcomes in patients treated with trastuzumab."
