abstract = "Psychology has been in crisis. Over the past 15 years many high-impact research findings have failed to replicate, calling into question their validity. Increased methodological and statistical scrutiny has led to field-wide introspection on how best to produce robust, reproducible, research. One focus has been on the use of questionable research practices. Previous estimates of the number of researchers who use questionable research practices vary widely, from over 60% to near 10%. In the current work, the authors produced three estimates of the number of American psychologists who have used questionable research practices in the last 12 months, utilizing direct, indirect, and social network measures of estimation. We estimate up to 24.40% of American psychologists have recently used at least one questionable research practice. These estimates represent the first step in generating actionable interventions to resolve the current replication crisis and increase trust in published research."
