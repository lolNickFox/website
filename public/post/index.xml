      <title>My Long, Strange Trip Through Graduate School</title>

      <description>It took me 10 years to go from an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry to a PhD in Social Psychology. Along the way I dropped out of a PhD program, worked as a lab manager, re-applied and re-entered graduate school, changed PhD advisors, and changed sub-disciplines of study. There are many ways to be successful in graduate school. If your goal is to most fully complete your education by earning your PhD, you can do it – even if you hit some bumps!</description>

      <description>I just preprinted my first 1st-author paper. Exciting! You can find it here: How Many Psychologists Use Questionable Research Practices?
I used this paper as a project to learn how to create a fully reproducible paper. By that, I mean a person could take my data files and my “paper” file and fully reproduce the paper (including analyses, figures, tables, etc) and the final document all in one step. The special part of this process is the “paper” file.</description>

      <description>Two scientists performing science. from the-scientist.com, July 2011
I just got back from the annual meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) and had a great time talking to a number of psychologists looking to help promote open, reproducible science. It really got me thinking about all the different kinds of science I’ve been a part of in my undergraduate and graduate career.
For a very long time I was a cellular biologist.</description>

      <title>The hypocritical silence of “free speech” academics on net neutrality</title>

Recently there have been several highly publicized protests of speakers on college campuses. Most, but not all, of these speakers have been associated with conservative politics or viewpoints that challenge current ideas on social justice (Ann Coulter, Milo Yiannopoulos, Charles Murray, etc). At Heterodox Academy and across most mainstream news outlets, academics and college administrators have spoken up about the possible threats to free speech on campus posed by student groups protesting to silence these speakers.</description>
