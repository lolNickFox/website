      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I cover some of the trends in R01 funding from 2000 to 2014.  Of interest is the effect of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as The 2009 Stimulus.  As an effort to reduce the negative economic impact of the 2008 Recession, the federal government increased the budgets of many public institutions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  In this talk, I present how ARRA dollars changed the distribution of R01 funds to downstream scientists. I conclude with recommendations for diversifying R01 funding to more scientists, spreading the money across more labs to decrease waste spending and increase diversity of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is in preperation for an upcoming publication.&lt;/p&gt;
