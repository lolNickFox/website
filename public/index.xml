      <title>Measuring the Size of Hidden Populations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people live with stigma, or some trait that devalues them in the view of others.  For some, this stigma can be concealed - sexual orientation or smoking can both be stigmatizing but can be kept secret from other people.  However, there are many times where it is important to know how many people identify with a particular stigma.  For example, drug users who use needles are at an increased risk for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens.  Sex workers are at an increased risk for HIV, sexually transmitted infection, and personal violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked directly, individuals with concealable stigma have the option of either concealing their identity (denying their identity when asked) or reveal their identity.  This decision to conceal or reveal is a complex one that entails how likely it is they will be &amp;ldquo;outed&amp;rdquo; by their own behaviors or somebody else, the perceived repercussions of having their identity revealed, and the prospect of social support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to try and count the number of people with concealable stigmas is to use social networks.  By tapping into the shared information that exists within social networks, researchers can glean the number of people have certain characteristcs by asking members of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently applying this methodology to academic social networks in an effort to measure the number of researchers who use questionable research practices (QRPs).  Use of these QRPs has led to an increase in the number of scientific findings that are not replicatable.  It is important to understand the number of researchers who engage in these questionable practices in order to construct meaningful interventions and to monitor the efficacy of these interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cash Rules Everything Around Me: R01 Funding &amp; the Diversity of Ideas</title>
      <link>/talk/sips2017/</link>

      <guid>/talk/sips2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I cover some of the trends in R01 funding from 2000 to 2014.  Of interest is the effect of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as The 2009 Stimulus.  As an effort to reduce the negative economic impact of the 2008 Recession, the federal government increased the budgets of many public institutions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  In this talk, I present how ARRA dollars changed the distribution of R01 funds to downstream scientists. I conclude with recommendations for diversifying R01 funding to more scientists, spreading the money across more labs to decrease waste spending and increase diversity of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is in preperation for an upcoming publication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The hypocritical silence of “free speech” academics on net neutrality</title>

&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been several highly publicized protests of speakers on college campuses. Most, but not all, of these speakers have been associated with conservative politics or viewpoints that challenge current ideas on social justice (Ann Coulter, Milo Yiannopoulos, Charles Murray, etc). At Heterodox Academy and across most mainstream news outlets, academics and college administrators have spoken up about the possible threats to free speech on campus posed by student groups protesting to silence these speakers. They argue that the best way to combat speech you do not agree with is more speech, and that when those speakers are silenced, their ideas are never openly challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many free speech-defending academics uphold the university as a “marketplace of ideas” (John Stewart Mill), this is a tired notion that is no longer true. &lt;strong&gt;There is a new marketplace of ideas, and it is the Internet.&lt;/strong&gt; On the Internet, controversial speakers on both the Left and the Right have a free platform to generate and promote their ideas to the public. The internet is widely available for consumption, at home or on the go - much more widely available than a lecture hall on some college campus. A university talk is no longer the place where ideas are batted around in search of the truth - it is now where books and podcasts are hyped to increase sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could students protest a speaker if they did not already know their platform? It is easy to research Milo, or Ann Coulter on the Internet today and know their viewpoint in five minutes. Campus talks are no longer required to gain insight into opinions you may not agree with - most of us carry the tools we need for that in our pocket or backpack. &lt;strong&gt;We are now living in a world where opposing opinions are easier to come across and argue against than ever before&lt;/strong&gt;, just scroll through the comments section of any news article to see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability for individuals across the political spectrum to voice their opinions on the Internet unfettered has recently come under attack. Back in 2015, the FCC adopted rules to protect net neutrality, meaning Internet service providers (ISPs) could not interfere with the generation or access of information on the web. At the time, this was seen as a victory in protecting free speech across the Internet. However, in May 2017, the new FCC chairperson appointed under President Trump, Ajit Pai, has spearheaded actions to roll back these FCC rules protecting equal access to material on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what is so baffling about the deafening silence from academics when it comes to net neutrality. On the one hand, student protests on campus are seen as a real threat to the rich variety of thought at our universities. On the other hand, when the largest democratic arena of free thought has its freedom threatened by large Internet service providers…there is hardly an objection. Where is the academic concern over ISPs gating the kinds of information you can find on the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an issue far more dangerous to free speech than a conservative podcaster having their invited talk on campus canceled. The number of total students across all universities (20.5 million in the U.S) is dwarfed by the number of people using the Internet (240.7 million in the U.S) to inform their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real outrage on campus should be focused on these academics who have yet to respond to the largest threat to free speech yet.&lt;/strong&gt; I call on my fellow academics (students, faculty, and the professorship) to redirect some of the energy being spent on campus climate towards the greater threat of a less accessible Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
