      <description>It took me 10 years to go from an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry to a PhD in Social Psychology. Along the way I dropped out of a PhD program, worked as a lab manager, re-applied and re-entered graduate school, changed PhD advisors, and changed sub-disciplines of study. There are many ways to be successful in graduate school. If your goal is to most fully complete your education by earning your PhD, you can do it â€“ even if you hit some bumps!</description>
