      <description>How does the mother&amp;rsquo;s immune system influence the developing offspring? What role do T cells play? These were the driving question behind my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree research.

We found that offspring from mothers who were sick during pregnancy had reduced success in using spatial memory to navigate a maze.</description>
