      <description>Many people live with stigma, or some trait that devalues them in the view of others. For some, this stigma can be concealed - sexual orientation or smoking can both be stigmatizing but can be kept secret from other people. However, there are many times where it is important to know how many people identify with a particular stigma. For example, drug users who use needles are at an increased risk for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens.</description>

      <description>How does the mother&amp;rsquo;s immune system influence the developing offspring? What role do T cells play? These were the driving question behind my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree research. Here, we experimentally activated the T cells of pregnant mice mid-gestation and monitored the offspring as they grew up into adulthood. When adults, we tested their spatial learning behaviors.
We found that offspring from mothers who were sick during pregnancy had reduced success in using spatial memory to navigate a maze.</description>
